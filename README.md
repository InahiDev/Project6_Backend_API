# Project6_Backend_API

My tasks on this project were to build a secured API to feed the front and part developped with Angular.</br>

## Building the server, the logic and the security of an API ##

From the server to the controllers, everything works fine on its own.</br>
If some security checks were implmented directly in the front end, I choosed to totally ignore them and secured the API diredctly on the server side.</br>
The DataBase is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.</br>
You can create an account that will be needed to enjoy the rest of the app.</br>
There still is some improvments to make on this project like an admin role, or the option to add comments on posts. For now, only like fonctionnality is settled up.</br>
The bonus i allready brought to this project is not a very fun one, and not a functionnality you will see directly on screen. It's only the fact that this site will not keep extra and unused picture everytime a user will upload a new pic.</br>
I kept the code not compressed to keep the clarity and the readability of the logic and concepts I used in this project.
